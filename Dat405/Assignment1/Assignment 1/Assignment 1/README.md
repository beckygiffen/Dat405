
-The programme starts
- there is a timer for 20 seconds which is displayed at the top of the screen
- the timer counts down from 20 until it gets to 0
- there is a permanent large circle in the screen which randomly changes colour on the monochrome scale
- when you move your mouse, squares of a 50 by 50 will appear and a circle of a random size following the mouse
-when you click the mouse, a random letter of a random size and random RGB colour will appear at that point
-when the timer gets to 0, the whole page refreshes and you will have 20 seconds again
