Rebecca Giffen Assignment 2 ReadMe document:

-For this project I decided to use a Twitter API to search for the most recent tweets that include a word or phrase of the users choice.
- Firstly, there is an automatic Keyword in the sketch JS document which can be changed if preferred. For convenience I have used the word “trump”.
- When the browser is open, the page will automatically display data from “trump”.
- the data is represented by small white circles, which look like stars in the sky. When the mouse hovers over these circles, the text from that tweet is displayed next to the circle. The circle also changes to turquoise to show that that’s the circle you are on.
- There is a box at the bottom of the page where the user can type their preferred word or phrase into and then press the “search” button.
- when the search button is pressed, the page will then refresh after searching for that piece of text over twitter.
- The data displayed is set to realtime so shows the most recent tweet containing your key words.
